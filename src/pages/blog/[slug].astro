          <h3>Summary</h3>
          <p>After running an insurance software startup and reviewing dozens of platforms, I've learned to distinguish AI theater from AI that actually works. The pattern is consistent: AI fails when it attempts to replace human judgment on complex, ambiguous tasks. It succeeds when it augments human expertise on focused, well-defined ones. The winners in this space won't be the companies with the most impressive demos—they'll be the ones solving boring problems exceptionally well.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>The Problem with AI in Insurance</h3>
        <p>Every insurtech pitch deck has an AI slide. Document ingestion. Automated underwriting. End-to-end claims processing. The promises are bold and the demos are impressive—watch the system parse a complex submission in seconds, extracting dozens of data points that would take an experienced underwriter the better part of an hour to compile manually.</p>
        <p>Then you deploy it in production. Reality hits fast.</p>
        <p>Complex specialty supplementals—the kind with handwritten notes in the margins, inconsistent formatting across pages, and domain-specific terminology that varies by region—break these systems with remarkable consistency. The AI confidently extracts incorrect values. It hallucinates fields that don't exist in the source document. It misinterprets context in ways that would be obvious to any human reader with industry experience.</p>
        <p>The result? The underwriter now spends more time correcting the AI's mistakes than they would have spent simply reading the document themselves. The efficiency gain evaporates. The frustration compounds.</p>
        <p>This is what I call AI theater: technology that performs brilliantly on stage during carefully orchestrated demonstrations, then crumbles under the weight of real-world complexity.</p>

        <h3>Why Theater Persists in the Market</h3>
        <p>The incentive structures in insurtech actively reward theatrical AI implementations. Investors want to hear "AI-powered" in the pitch. Buyers want to check the innovation box in their procurement process. Sales teams know that a flashy demo closes deals faster than a honest conversation about capabilities and limitations.</p>
        <p>And the demos themselves? They're carefully choreographed performances. Clean documents with standard formatting. Common submission types that represent the easy 70% of the distribution. Predictable inputs that the system has been specifically tuned to handle.</p>
        <p>But insurance—particularly specialty insurance—is inherently messy. Specialty lines exist precisely because they involve edge cases that don't fit neatly into standard underwriting boxes. The submissions that matter most are often the ones that deviate from the norm. An 80% accuracy rate that sounds impressive in a pitch deck means that 20% of submissions still require manual review—and those tend to be the most complex, highest-value, and most consequential submissions in the queue.</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>"Automation applied to an inefficient operation will magnify the inefficiency."</p>
          <cite>— Bill Gates</cite>
        </blockquote>
        <p>The same principle applies to AI in insurance workflows. If your underlying process is messy and full of exceptions, throwing AI at it won't magically create order. It will amplify the chaos and introduce new failure modes that didn't exist before.</p>

        <h3>Four AI Applications That Actually Deliver Value</h3>
        <p>After spending years building our own tools and systematically evaluating competitors across the insurtech landscape, I've identified four categories of AI applications that consistently deliver measurable value in production environments:</p>

        <p><strong>1. Summarization</strong></p>
        <p>AI excels at condensing lengthy, complex documents into digestible briefs that humans can quickly scan and evaluate. The key distinction here is important: this is not about extracting specific fields or structured data from unstructured documents. That's where AI theater lives. This is about synthesizing context and presenting the essential narrative of a submission.</p>
        <p>An underwriter can read a well-crafted two-paragraph summary and make an informed decision about whether to invest time diving deeper into the full submission. For the significant percentage of submissions that will ultimately be declined, this represents hours of saved time. The AI handles the cognitive labor of initial filtering; the human retains full authority over the judgment call.</p>

        <p><strong>2. Underwriting Guidance Based on Existing Guidelines</strong></p>
        <p>When you feed AI your organization's actual underwriting guidelines—rather than training it to develop new ones from historical data—it becomes a genuinely powerful co-pilot for your underwriting team. The system can flag submissions that violate your stated appetite before an underwriter invests significant time in analysis. It can suggest relevant questions based on your established criteria. It can ensure consistency across a distributed team where individual underwriters might otherwise apply subtly different interpretations of the same guidelines.</p>
        <p>The critical insight here is that the AI isn't making underwriting decisions. It's ensuring that human underwriters have the right information and context to make better decisions more efficiently. The guidelines come from human expertise; the AI simply operationalizes their consistent application.</p>

        <p><strong>3. Sourcing Data at Scale</strong></p>
        <p>AI is exceptionally good at gathering and organizing external data from multiple sources: property characteristics from public records, business information from various databases, market comparables from historical transactions, regulatory filings, news mentions, and dozens of other signals that inform underwriting decisions.</p>
        <p>These are tasks that require breadth rather than depth. The AI finds and aggregates; the human reviews and judges. No complex interpretation is required—just efficient collection and organization of information that would take a human analyst hours to compile manually. The underwriter's time is then freed to focus on analysis and judgment rather than data gathering.</p>

        <p><strong>4. Validation of Submitted Assets</strong></p>
        <p>Checking whether a submitted photo actually matches a property description. Verifying that uploaded documents are what they claim to be. Confirming that certificates and attestations appear authentic. These are binary validation tasks where AI can flag anomalies for human review without making final determinations.</p>
        <p>The pattern here is risk reduction through systematic verification. The AI doesn't decide whether a submission is fraudulent—it identifies submissions that warrant closer human scrutiny. False positives are acceptable because the cost of human review is low. False negatives are minimized because the AI applies consistent checking across every submission.</p>

        <h3>Deterministic vs. Non-Deterministic: You Need Both</h3>
        <p>There's a related debate in insurtech that often gets flattened into false binaries: should systems be deterministic (rule-based, predictable, same input always yields same output) or non-deterministic (probabilistic, AI-driven, adapting to context)?</p>
        <p>The answer, unsurprisingly, is both. But knowing when to apply each is where most platforms get it wrong.</p>
        <p><strong>Deterministic tools excel where the rules are clear and the stakes of inconsistency are high.</strong> Compliance checks. Regulatory requirements. Appetite boundaries that should never flex. If your guidelines say you don't write restaurants with fryers over 50 gallons, that's not a judgment call—it's a hard rule. A deterministic system enforces it the same way every time, creates an auditable trail, and never hallucinates an exception that doesn't exist.</p>
        <p>Non-deterministic tools—the AI and ML systems that dominate insurtech marketing—excel in a different domain entirely. They handle ambiguity. They synthesize unstructured information. They surface patterns that would be invisible to rule-based systems. The summarization, data sourcing, and validation tasks I described earlier all benefit from non-deterministic approaches precisely because the inputs are messy and the "right answer" isn't always binary.</p>
        <p>The mistake I see repeatedly is platforms trying to use non-deterministic AI for tasks that demand deterministic consistency. An underwriter asks why the system flagged one submission but not another with similar characteristics. The answer—"the model weighted these features differently based on contextual factors"—is technically accurate and operationally useless. For compliance-critical decisions, you need to be able to explain exactly why something happened. Every time. To regulators, to auditors, to the underwriter who needs to trust the system.</p>
        <p>The best architectures I've seen treat this as a layering problem. Deterministic rules form the foundation—the hard boundaries that never move. Non-deterministic AI operates within those boundaries, handling the ambiguity and complexity that rules can't capture. The human sits on top, applying judgment to the cases that neither system can resolve with confidence.</p>
        <p>It's less exciting than "end-to-end AI underwriting." But it actually works.</p>

        <h3>The Underlying Pattern</h3>
        <p><strong>AI works when it augments human judgment, not when it attempts to replace it.</strong></p>
        <p>Each of the four successful applications above shares a common structure:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Summarization gives underwriters better inputs for their decisions</li>
          <li>Guidance ensures they're applying consistent criteria across the organization</li>
          <li>Data sourcing expands what they can realistically consider in their analysis</li>
          <li>Validation catches potential errors before they compound into larger problems</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In every case, the human remains firmly in control of the judgment. The AI handles the cognitive labor that doesn't require expertise—the filtering, gathering, checking, and organizing. The human applies the expertise that AI cannot reliably replicate—the contextual judgment, the pattern recognition born of experience, the intuition about what feels wrong even when the data looks right.</p>
        <p>None of these applications are as exciting as "fully automated underwriting." They don't make for compelling pitch deck slides or breathless press releases. But they ship. They work in production. They deliver measurable ROI. And they don't create new categories of expensive failures.</p>

        <h3>The Question to Ask</h3>
        <p>The companies that ultimately win in insurtech won't be the ones with the most impressive demos or the boldest claims about AI capabilities. They'll be the ones solving specific, well-defined problems where AI's genuine strengths align with the task requirements—and where human expertise remains central to the value chain.</p>
        <p>The next time you evaluate an AI feature in an insurance platform, ask yourself a simple question: Is this theater, or is this work?</p>
        <p>The answer will tell you everything you need to know about whether the capability will survive contact with your actual production environment.</p>

        <p>10 different types of stories to tell as a leader and some tips on how to craft them.</p>

        <p>The importance of crafting narratives for leadership contexts, particularly "broadcast meetings" where leaders communicate organizational vision to new team members, partners, or existing staff.</p>

        <h3>Ten Essential Leadership Stories</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Origin story (founding narrative)</li>
          <li>Case for change (urgency/vision shift)</li>
          <li>Future vision narrative</li>
          <li>Strategic execution plan</li>
          <li>Values and beliefs framework</li>
          <li>Customer focus story</li>
          <li>Customer success case study</li>
          <li>Competitive differentiation</li>
          <li>Leadership philosophy</li>
          <li>Organizational culture/recruitment narrative</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Storytelling Guidelines</h3>
        <p><strong>Recommended practices include:</strong></p>
        <ul>

        <p>Effective leadership development relies on self-inquiry rather than formulaic answers. Drawing on research from Claire Lew at Knowyourteam.com, here are four reflective questions for managers.</p>

        <h3>1. How can I create an environment for people to do their best work?</h3>
        <p>Leaders should focus on shaping environments rather than manipulating people—controlling communication, decisions, and support gestures within their direct influence.</p>

        <h3>2. How can I create clarity about what needs doing and why?</h3>
        <p>Managers must communicate vision, mission, and goals beyond their own understanding, connecting work's relevance to individual team members.</p>

        <h3>3. How can I model desired behavior across my team?</h3>
        <p>Leaders earn trust through personal exemplification—punctuality, honest feedback, and consistency demonstrate authentic commitment.</p>

        <h3>4. How can I see things as they are, not as desired?</h3>
        <p>Clear perception of current reality prevents leadership surprises.</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>"The most effective people are those who can 'hold' their vision while remaining committed to seeing current reality clearly."</p>
          <cite>— Peter Senge, The Fifth Discipline</cite>
        </blockquote>

        <p>The key is iterative self-reflection through regular questioning over prescribed management checklists.</p>

        <p>The leader's job is to cultivate the type of culture that will lead to success.</p>

        <p>Drawing from Daniel Coyle's <em>The Culture Code</em>, there are three essential elements:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Build safety</strong> — fostering secure environments</li>
          <li><strong>Share vulnerability</strong> — encouraging risk-taking for cooperation</li>
          <li><strong>Establish purpose</strong> — aligning around shared goals</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>See the Role You Play in Team Culture</h3>
        <p>Leaders establish norms through modeling behavior. One bad apple or toxic employee can bring down the whole team. Leaders must actively cultivate desired culture rather than allowing negative dynamics to develop organically.</p>

        <h3>Creating Connections</h3>
        <p>Strategies for building cohesion include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Enforcing collaboration on shared problems</li>
          <li>Encouraging direct peer feedback</li>
          <li>Recognizing collaborative achievements</li>
          <li>Creating trust-building opportunities</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Define Your Culture by Knowing Its Value</h3>
        <p>Leaders should identify <em>why</em> the team exists beyond functional roles, considering advantages of collective work (learning, decision-making quality, resource pooling).</p>

        <h3>How to Create Cultural Touchpoints Around Your Values</h3>
        <p>Implementation requires daily practices, not mere statements. Examples include code review processes, brown bag sessions, or standardized reporting formats.</p>

        <h3>Team Structure Becomes Team Culture</h3>
        <p>Culture emerges from everyday actions—communication styles, decision procedures, meeting formats—not symbolic gestures.</p>
        <p>Practical examples:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Weekly demo meetings showcasing accomplishments</li>
          <li>Teaching slots during team meetings</li>
          <li>Celebration rituals (e.g., cupcakes for launches)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Let the Culture Expand from the Top Down</h3>
        <p>Delegation of culture-building responsibilities to team members creates genuine ownership and inclusivity.</p>

          If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew<br>
          To serve your turn long after they are gone,<br>
          And so hold on when there is nothing in you<br>
          Except the Will which says to them: 'Hold on!'<br><br>

          If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,<br>
          Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,<br>
          If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,<br>
          If all men count with you, but none too much;<br><br>

          If you can fill the unforgiving minute<br>
          With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,<br>
          Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,<br>
          And—which is more—you'll be a Man, my son!</p>

          <h3>Summary</h3>
          <p>Success is achieved not when the CEO thinks something is important, but when everyone does. This essay covers practical internal communication tactics from leaders at Salesforce, Drift, Front, and PayPal. Key principles: narratives move people more than facts; always explain the "why" before the "what"; alignment requires two-way communication; and repetition is essential—you must repeat messages until you're sick of saying them. Practical frameworks include weekly team updates, V2MOM goal-setting, all-hands meeting notes, and personal newsletters to build organizational alignment at scale.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>The Fundamental Premise</h3>
        <p>Most of us are wired to believe that if we say something, those who hear us will just naturally execute it exactly as we had envisioned it in the first place. If only managing people were that easy. In reality, just because you said, doesn't mean it's actually going to happen. Without providing the right direction, determination, and ongoing communication about the context of the work to be done, the chances of actually observing the result you envisioned are very low.</p>

        <p>The fundamental premise is that success is achieved not when the CEO thinks something is important, but when everyone thinks it is.</p>

        <h3>Narratives (not facts) are what move people</h3>
        <p>Subtract facts from reality, and what's left is storytelling. Great leaders know that while facts help people understand and comprehend reality, it's in narratives that make enthusiasm, excitement and passion "happen". Ultimately, we are the stories that we tell.</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>"If you want to build a ship, don't drum up people to collect wood and don't assign them tasks and work, but rather teach them to long for the endless immensity of the sea."</p>
          <cite>— Antoine de Saint-Exupery</cite>
        </blockquote>

        <p>When communicating important new messages, rather than presenting new facts try thinking of it as broaching a new narrative. Think of what you're trying to accomplish in a broader and more holistic way, surrounding the facts (the actual company goals and milestones) with a convincing and appealing narrative.</p>

        <h3>The why always before the what</h3>
        <p>Your best people want to know the why and understand the broader context beyond their individual responsibilities. Just because you said the what, it won't magically make it happen unless you have a very convincing why. To make things happen you need to spend a disproportionate amount of time on the why than the what.</p>

        <p>Your audience is already busy with their own work. In order to get them to take notice, and far more importantly, change behavior, it's essential you provide the context behind your message. The deeper you get into the why the more they will buy into your message.</p>

        <h3>Alignment is not one-way only</h3>
        <p>No matter how clear and profound your explanations, after explaining the facts and your narrative, it's equally critical that the team feels heard on the subject. People have different perspectives and it's vital that communication goes both ways. People must be able to ask questions and offer critiques and ideas.</p>

        <h3>Repeat, repeat, repeat</h3>
        <p>David Gergen, former advisor to several US presidents wrote:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>"History teaches that almost nothing a leader says is heard if spoken only once"</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>There's no doubt here: repetition is the mother of all learning. If you want to inculcate in people a specific message or a specific new set of behaviors, you have to repeat things. To make sure your message is really percolating down to every member of the organization, you have to repeat it so often that "you grow sick of hearing yourself say it" as Jeff Weiner from LinkedIn simply put.</p>

        <h3>How to Communicate as a Founder CEO</h3>

        <p><strong>Weekly Team Update:</strong> One of the best communication strategies for entrepreneurs is a weekly update email to employees, advisors, mentors, and investors. The email gives an overview of tactical updates from the previous week and for the week ahead. The basic macro elements: revenues, recruiting, product and customers.</p>

        <p><strong>Metrics Weekly Round-Up:</strong> Peter Thiel, back in his days as Founder/CEO at PayPal, used to run internal weekly and monthly staff meetings to discuss every single metric behind the company's progress. Aggregate the top three most important company-wide metrics in a single digest delivered to everyone.</p>

        <p><strong>Beyond the Obvious Weekly:</strong> As a Founder CEO there are certain things about your company that only you can see. Sharing your thoughts in internal memos is critical to helping the people around you understand the broader context of your vision.</p>

        <p><strong>Personal Weekly Newsletter:</strong> Write a personally curated publication shared weekly with your entire company. This helps share the thoughts that wouldn't normally make it into an all-hands meeting. David Cancel, Drift Founder/CEO, writes a weekly email newsletter every Sunday night—anyone can subscribe whether they work at Drift or not.</p>

        <p><strong>All-Hands Meeting Notes:</strong> This is probably the most important meeting in your entire company. Maximize coverage by sending company-wide minutes after the meeting has ended.</p>

        <h3>Quarterly V2MOM</h3>
        <p>One of the best examples comes from Marc Benioff at Salesforce. V2MOM stands for: Vision, Values, Methods, Obstacles, and Measures.</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Vision:</strong> Define what you want the team to do</li>
          <li><strong>Values:</strong> Establish what is most important about that vision</li>
          <li><strong>Methods:</strong> Illustrate how you will get the job done</li>
          <li><strong>Obstacles:</strong> Identify challenges you may have to overcome</li>
          <li><strong>Measures:</strong> Specify the actual result you aim to achieve</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The V2MOM is an exercise in awareness, the result of which is total company alignment.</p>

        <h3>What a Founder CEO should expect from their exec team</h3>
        <p>Your responsibilities include the communication of your entire executive team. Expect your exec teams to distribute context at the edge of the organization.</p>

        <p><strong>Make public meeting notes:</strong> Jack Dorsey famously initiated the meeting-notes policy at Square: "Any meeting of more than two people, someone's required to take notes and send them to an [email] alias."</p>

        <p><strong>Email Transparency:</strong> Stripe was one of the first companies to embrace full email transparency. By convention, every email at Stripe is CC-ed to lists that go to either the entire company or to a particular team.</p>

        <h3>General Principles</h3>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Cut through the clutter:</strong> Pick a medium where people are actually able to focus and read at a slower pace.</li>
          <li><strong>Pick an internal naming convention:</strong> Create an emotional connection between your messages and your people. Find terminology that resonates and jumps off the page.</li>
          <li><strong>Be Consistent:</strong> Once the schedule is made, never miss an update. Once the medium is selected, never change it. Once the tone is established, never subvert it.</li>
          <li><strong>Measure, Measure, Measure:</strong> Just like you measure everything about your product, measure everything about your internal comms.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Conclusions</h3>
        <p>Good communication compounds over time. But by the same token, the implications of bad communication magnify progressively. If your people aren't informed by you, there's a good chance they'll be misinformed by others.</p>

        <p>Poor information and unaddressed knowledge gaps compound over time and lead to all sorts of inconsistent contexts, and differing contexts are the root cause of conflict and unnecessary disagreements.</p>

        <p>The job of communicating is simply never done. Work hard to make it part of the daily routine of yourself and the leaders and the operators in your company.</p>
